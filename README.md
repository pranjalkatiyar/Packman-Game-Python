# Packman-Game-Python

Pacman -- classic arcade game. Use the arrow keys to navigate and eat all the white food. Watch out for red ghosts that roam the maze.

Pac-Man is an action maze chase video game; the player controls the eponymous character through an enclosed maze. The objective of the game is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while avoiding colored ghosts — red here — that pursue him. And score highest by  eating all dots and by saving yourself from red ghosts by moving Arrows.
